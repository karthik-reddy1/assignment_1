            <h3>Login Page with authentication</h3>
            <p>Description: Developed a secure and user-friendly login page as part of a web application. The login system allows users to authenticate using their credentials and access personalized content. The project focused on creating a smooth user experience while ensuring data security.

                Technologies Used:
                
                Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for designing the login interface and adding form validation.
                Backend: Node.js, Express.js for handling user authentication and server-side logic.
                Database: MongoDB for securely storing user credentials and session data.
                Security: Implemented password hashing using bcrypt and integrated JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
                Purpose: The purpose of this project was to create a robust authentication system that provides secure access to users and protects sensitive data, laying the groundwork for larger, scalable web applications.

            <h3>Chess Board</h3>
            <p>This project is a web-based interactive Chess Board application that allows users to play a standard game of chess directly in their browser. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly interface for both beginner and advanced chess players. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The logic for the chess moves and game rules was implemented in JavaScript, ensuring accurate and real-time validation of legal moves. The layout and design were handled through CSS to provide a visually appealing and responsive board, while HTML was used to structure the game elements. This project not only enhanced my understanding of game development but also improved my problem-solving skills in complex logic implementation.</p>
